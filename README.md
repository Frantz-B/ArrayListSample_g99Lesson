# ArrayListSample_g99Lesson
Lessons 32 &amp; 33

In this Sample code, reviewed how one can grow or shrink an Array List thus making it dynamic.  It was a interesting lesson.  Also added a lite Switch example just cuz it was the next to on the site's list. There was a really cool example of using an Array List but parameterizing it with a Custom class instead of String or Interger.  Link to this code is below.

ArrayList where it was parameterized with a custom class 'Philosopher' which was really cool :  http://www.dotnetperls.com/arraylist-java
